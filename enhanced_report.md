# Penetration Testing Toolkit - Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of an automated security assessment conducted on May 14, 2025, using the PenTest Toolkit. The assessment targeted two domains: example.com and google.com, focusing on port scanning, service enumeration, and network path analysis.

The assessment identified several open ports and services on both targets, which could potentially be leveraged for further security testing. This report is provided for educational and authorized security testing purposes only.

## Methodology

The assessment utilized the following techniques:
- Port scanning (TCP Connect)
- Service identification
- Host discovery
- Network path analysis

## Target 1: example.com

### Basic Information
- **Hostname**: example.com
- **IP Address**: 23.215.0.138
- **Status**: Up
- **Scan Duration**: 35.47 seconds

### Port Scan Results

| PORT | STATE | SERVICE | BANNER |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 21   | open  | ftp     | None   |
| 80   | open  | http    | None   |
| 443  | open  | https   | None   |

### Common Services

| PORT | SERVICE |
|------|---------|
| 21   | FTP     |
| 80   | HTTP    |
| 443  | HTTPS   |

### Findings and Recommendations

1. **Open FTP Service (Port 21)**
   - **Finding**: FTP service is exposed to the internet.
   - **Risk**: FTP often transmits credentials in cleartext and may allow anonymous access.
   - **Recommendation**: Consider replacing with SFTP or FTPS if file transfer is necessary. If not required, disable this service.

2. **Web Services (Ports 80, 443)**
   - **Finding**: Both HTTP and HTTPS services are running.
   - **Risk**: HTTP transmits data in cleartext.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection and ensure proper TLS configuration.

## Target 2: google.com

### Basic Information
- **Hostname**: google.com
- **IP Address**: 142.250.182.206
- **Status**: Up
- **Scan Duration**: 33.00 seconds

### Port Scan Results

| PORT | STATE | SERVICE | BANNER |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 80   | open  | http    | HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request |
| 443  | open  | https   | (Partial banner) |

### Common Services

| PORT | SERVICE |
|------|---------|
| 21   | FTP     |
| 80   | HTTP    |
| 443  | HTTPS   |
| 1723 | PPTP    |

### Findings and Recommendations

1. **Web Services (Ports 80, 443)**
   - **Finding**: Both HTTP and HTTPS services are running.
   - **Risk**: HTTP transmits data in cleartext.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection and ensure proper TLS configuration.

2. **PPTP Service (Port 1723)**
   - **Finding**: PPTP VPN service is potentially available.
   - **Risk**: PPTP has known security vulnerabilities.
   - **Recommendation**: Consider replacing with more secure VPN protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard.

## Security Posture Assessment

### example.com
The target has standard web services running with an additional FTP service. The presence of FTP represents a potential security concern as it may allow unauthorized access if not properly secured. The web services appear to be properly configured with both HTTP and HTTPS available.

### google.com
The target has a robust security posture with primarily web-related services exposed. The detection of PPTP is interesting and would warrant further investigation in a real penetration test to determine if it's actually accessible or if it's a false positive from our scanning tool.

## Recommendations

1. **Service Hardening**
   - Disable unnecessary services (particularly FTP if not required)
   - Ensure all services are running the latest secure versions
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms

2. **Transport Layer Security**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all web traffic
   - Configure TLS with secure ciphers and protocols
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

3. **Network Security**
   - Implement firewall rules to restrict access to necessary services only
   - Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for web services
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

## Conclusion

This automated security assessment has identified several services running on the target systems. While no critical vulnerabilities were directly identified through our automated scanning, the presence of certain services (particularly FTP) warrants attention.

This report serves as a starting point for a more comprehensive security assessment. In a real-world penetration test, these findings would be followed by manual verification and deeper testing to identify actual vulnerabilities.
